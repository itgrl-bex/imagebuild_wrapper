## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/itgrl-bex/imagebuild_wrapper/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/itgrl-bex/imagebuild_wrapper/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
* Start a [discussion](https://github.com/itgrl-bex/imagebuild_wrapper/discussions) suggesting the change.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily used for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about imagebuild_wrapper in the [discussions](https://github.com/itgrl-bex/imagebuild_wrapper/discussions) page.
